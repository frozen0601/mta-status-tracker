# MTA Status Tracker

A back-end coding test project built with **Django** and containerized using **Docker**.

This project offers APIs to track subway line statuses and uptime, leveraging real-time data from the MTA.

-   **Tech Stack**:
    -   Backend: Django 5
    -   Task Queue & Scheduler: Celery
    -   Database: SQLite (default for simplicity)
    -   Caching: Redis
    -   Containerization: Docker

## Kanban Board

Project tracking is available on the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/frozen0601/projects/3).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Folder**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/mta-status-tracker.git
    cd mta-status-tracker
    ```
2. **Create `.env` at the root of the project with the following context**
    ```bash
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.base
    DEBUG=False
    ```

2. **(on First Run) Initialize the Project**
   
   Run the following command to build the Docker environment and run.

    ```bash
    make init
    ```

    `make init` is equivalent to:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py seed_subway_lines
    ```

4. **Run**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    or
   
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```

    `make deploy` is equivalent to:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py seed_subway_lines
    ```

## API Endpoints
API documentation is available via ReDoc at [http://localhost:8000/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/redoc/).

### 1. **Get Subway Line Status**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/status/`

**Description**:
Fetch the current status of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)
-   `status`: Filter by status (e.g., `normal`, `delayed`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/status/`: Show the status of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1`: Show the status of line 1.
-   `/api/subway/status?status=normal`: Show all lines that are normal.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1,2,3,4,5&status=delayed`: Among lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, show the delayed ones.

---

### 2. **Get Subway Line Uptime**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/uptime/`

**Description**:
Fetch the uptime of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/uptime/`: Show the uptime of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/uptime?line=1`: Show the uptime of line 1.

## Logging
MTA Line status are logged whenever their status changed (two states: `normal`/`delayed`) can be found in both the console and the log file (src/backend/logs/status_changes.log).

## Design Decisions  
The design choices below were made after considering the requirements and user scenarios. Iâ€™ve balanced current needs with future flexibility, keeping in mind that users might have different needs that could require changes down the line.

1. **Data Model Design**:  
   - **User story**: Users want real-time updates and accurate uptime stats.
   - **Solution**: Iâ€™m using a dual-model approach with `SubwayLine` and `StatusHistory`.
   - **Other options considered**:
     * For a focus on real-time: Could use just cached current status.
     * For heavy analytics: A time-series database could be a good fit.

2. **Status Tracking Strategy**:
   - **User story**: "I need the current status to be up-to-date."
   - **Things I looked into**:
     * What does "up-to-date" really mean for users? (This helped set the refresh rate.)
     * What happens during API outages? (This led to gap detection.)
     * How far back should I store history? (This influenced my compression strategy.)
       
3. **Performance**:
   - **Current assumption**: I expect more reads than writes.
   - **Designed for flexibility**:
     * Handles higher write loads.
     * Can store longer history (I might add an archival system later).
       
4. **Data Source Integration**:  
   - **Current setup**: Iâ€™m using a single MTA API (tried a first one but failedðŸ« )
   - **Future plans**:
     * Manage multiple data sources.
     * Support different transit systems.
     * Manage both real-time/batch updates.
       
5. **Future Adaptability**:
   - The system can grow to support:
     * Different ways to calculate uptime.
     * Additional performance metrics.
     * New reporting features.
     * Maybe more?

## To-Do
-   **Integrate Alternative Data Source:**
    - Finish `GTFSSubwayStatusProvider` (https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds)
    - For uptime percentage: https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/operationalmetrics
    - Explore the package [nyct-gtfs](https://github.com/Andrew-Dickinson/nyct-gtfs)
-   **Explore using Redis as the main spot for updates, processing, and serving data:**  
       - **Idea:** Redis can handle heavy traffic efficiently, acting as the primary data source for real-time updates while the database serves as a backup or journal for tracking delays and recovery.
       - **Benefits:**  
         - Significantly faster performance for high read/write traffic.
         - Reduced load on the database. (e.g., updating only when the line status changes or at a much lower frequency).
         - Ideal for real-time/transient data.
       - **Trade-offs:**  
         - **Data Loss Risk:** Redis is in-memory and volatile; crashes or restarts without persistence could lead to data loss.  
         - **Complexity and Historical Data:**  Redis alone isnâ€™t ideal for long-term storage or complex analytics. Using Redis alongside the database increases complexity due to the need of fallback mechanisms, sync processes, additional conditions, and whatnot.
         - **Expandability:** While Redis may meet current needs, its volatile nature limits its ability to support future features like more analytics. Having db in-place is still crucial.

## Notes & Learnings

- **GTFS-Realtime Protocol Buffers**:  
  I was able to successfully extract data using [gtfs-realtime.proto](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto) from the [data source](https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds).  
  I can also integrate the extention  ([source](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-gtfs-realtime-api/blob/master/src/main/proto/com/google/transit/realtime/gtfs-realtime-service-status.proto)), but I still ran into issues accessing the extension data.
