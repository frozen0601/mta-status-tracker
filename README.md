# MTA Status Tracker

A back-end coding test project built with **Django** and containerized using **Docker**.

This project offers APIs to track subway line statuses and uptime, leveraging real-time data from the MTA.

-   **Tech Stack**:
    -   Backend: Django 5
    -   Task Queue & Scheduler: Celery
    -   Database: SQLite (default for simplicity)
    -   Caching: Redis
    -   Containerization: Docker

## Kanban Board

Project tracking is available on the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/frozen0601/projects/3).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Folder**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/mta-status-tracker.git
    cd mta-status-tracker
    ```

2. **(on First Run) Initialize the Project**
   Run the following command to build the Docker environment, install dependencies, and set up the database:

    ```bash
    make init
    ```

    `make init` is equivalent to:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py seed_subway_lines
    ```

3. **Run**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    or
   
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```

    `make deploy` is equivalent to:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py seed_subway_lines
    ```

## API Endpoints
API documentation is available via ReDoc at [http://localhost:8000/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/redoc/).

### 1. **Get Subway Line Status**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/status/`

**Description**:
Fetch the current status of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)
-   `status`: Filter by status (e.g., `normal`, `delayed`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/status/`: Show the status of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1`: Show the status of line 1.
-   `/api/subway/status?status=normal`: Show all lines that are normal.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1,2,3,4,5&status=delayed`: Among lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, show the delayed ones.

---

### 2. **Get Subway Line Uptime**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/uptime/`

**Description**:
Fetch the uptime of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/uptime/`: Show the uptime of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/uptime?line=1`: Show the uptime of line 1.

## Logging
MTA Line status are logged whenever their status changed (two states: `normal`/`delayed`) can be found in both the console and the log file (src/backend/logs/status_changes.log).

## Design Decisions
  Throughout the development of this project, I placed the highest priority on readability, maintainability, and scalability.

1. **Pagination**:
   Pagination was not implemented because the dataset is small and results are naturally limited.

2. **Incremental Updates**:
   Instead of batch updating all subway line data, individual updates are applied. This approach allows for the use of Django signals for logging, resulting in cleaner and easier-to-manage code.

3. **Modular Data Fetching**:
   The third-party data fetching logic is encapsulated in `mta_data_fetcher.py`, which defines an abstract base class (`SubwayStatusProvider`). This modular design supports future extensibility, such as merging or dynamically choosing the best data source.

4. **Task Scheduling**:
   Celery is used over cron jobs for periodic data fetching to enable better scalability, monitoring, and retry mechanisms.

## To-Do
-   **Finish the `GTFSSubwayStatusProvider` as an alternative data source.**
-   **Explore using Redis as the main spot for updates, processing, and serving data:**  
   - **Idea:** Redis can handle heavy traffic efficiently, acting as the primary data source for real-time updates while the database serves as a backup or journal for tracking delays and recovery.
   - **Benefits:**  
     - Significantly faster performance for high read/write traffic.
     - Reduced load on the database. (e.g., updating only when the line status changes or at a much lower frequency).
     - Ideal for real-time/transient data.
   - **Trade-offs:**  
     - **Data Loss Risk:** Redis is in-memory and volatile; crashes or restarts without persistence could lead to data loss.  
     - **Complexity and Historical Data:**  Redis alone isnâ€™t ideal for long-term storage or complex analytics. Using Redis alongside the database increases complexity due to the need of fallback mechanisms, sync processes, additional conditions, and whatnot.
     - **Expandability:** While Redis may meet current needs, its volatile nature limits its ability to support future features like more analytics. Having db in-place is still crucial.

## Notes & Learnings

- **GTFS-Realtime Protocol Buffers**:  
  I was able to successfully extract data using [gtfs-realtime.proto](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto) from the [data source](https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds).  
  I can also integrate  the extention  ([source](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-gtfs-realtime-api/blob/master/src/main/proto/com/google/transit/realtime/gtfs-realtime-service-status.proto)), but I still ran into issues accessing the extension data.
