# MTA Status Tracker

A back-end coding test project built with **Django** and containerized using **Docker**.

This project offers APIs to track subway line statuses and uptime, leveraging real-time data from the MTA.

-   **Tech Stack**:
    -   Backend: Django 5
    -   Task Queue & Scheduler: Celery
    -   Database: SQLite (default for simplicity)
    -   Caching: Redis
    -   Containerization: Docker

## Kanban Board

Project tracking is available on the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/frozen0601/projects/3).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/mta-status-tracker.git
    cd mta-status-tracker
    ```

2. **Initialize the Project**
   Run the following command to build the Docker environment, install dependencies, and set up the database:

    ```bash
    make init
    ```

3. **Run the Project**
   Start the project with Docker:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints
API documentation is available via ReDoc at [http://localhost:8000/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/redoc/).

### 1. **Get Subway Line Status**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/status/`

**Description**:
Fetch the current status of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)
-   `status`: Filter by status (e.g., `normal`, `delayed`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/status/`: Show the status of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1`: Show the status of line 1.
-   `/api/subway/status?status=normal`: Show all lines that are normal.
-   `/api/subway/status?line=1,2,3,4,5&status=delayed`: Among lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, show the delayed ones.

### 2. **Get Subway Line Uptime**

**Endpoint**:
`[GET] /api/subway/uptime/`

**Description**:
Fetch the uptime of subway lines.

**Supported Filters**:

-   `line`: Comma-separated list of subway lines (e.g., `1,2,3`)

**Example Usage**:

-   `/api/subway/uptime/`: Show the uptime of all lines.
-   `/api/subway/uptime?line=1`: Show the uptime of line 1.

## Design Decisions
  Throughout the development of this project, I placed the highest priority on readability, maintainability, and scalability.

1. **Pagination**:
   Pagination was not implemented because the dataset is small and results are naturally limited.

2. **Incremental Updates**:
   Instead of batch updating all subway line data, individual updates are applied. This approach allows for the use of Django signals for logging, resulting in cleaner and easier-to-manage code.

3. **Modular Data Fetching**:
   The third-party data fetching logic is encapsulated in `mta_data_fetcher.py`, which defines an abstract base class (`SubwayStatusProvider`). This modular design supports future extensibility, such as merging or dynamically choosing the best data source.

4. **Task Scheduling**:
   Celery is used over cron jobs for periodic data fetching to enable better scalability, monitoring, and retry mechanisms.

## To-Do
-   Finish the `GTFSSubwayStatusProvider` as an alternative data source.  
-   Try using Redis as the main spot for updates, processing, and getting data.  
   - Idea: Redis can handle heavy traffic while the database works more like a backup or journal.
   - Trade-off: This could make things faster but might lose some data if Redis goes down. If thatâ€™s okay, this is worth a shot.

## Notes & Learnings

- **GTFS-Realtime Protocol Buffers**:  
  I was able to successfully extract data using `gtfs-realtime.proto` ([source](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto)) from the [source](https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds).  
  I can also integrate `mercury-gtfs-realtime.proto` ([source](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-gtfs-realtime-api/blob/master/src/main/proto/com/google/transit/realtime/gtfs-realtime-service-status.proto)), but I still ran into issues accessing the extension data.
